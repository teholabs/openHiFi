The goal of the openHiFi is to provide an open hardware music player for the home.

The target for this branch of openHiFi is the Procyon development board (LM3S9B9x Cortex M3)

The hardware is designed to be modular.

The firmware for openHiFi is based on a variety of sources and therefore there are several licenses involved.

Part of the ffmpeg library is linked to which is LGPL.
StellarisWare is used which forbids making the entire program GPL, but allows linking to LGPL.
Chan's FatFS and xprintf have a MIT like license. 
The rest of the code is MIT licensed.
